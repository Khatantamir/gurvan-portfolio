# Marketing Performance Analytics Dashboard (Portfolio)

## Overview
This repository presents a **marketing performance analytics dashboard** built as a **portfolio project**.

The dashboard focuses on tracking key marketing KPIs such as **ROAS, CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate, and revenue trends** using structured datasets and clear visual reporting.

The project demonstrates practical analytics skills in **Power BI**, KPI design, and business-oriented performance reporting using transparent and reproducible workflows.

---

## Project Goal
Marketing teams often need a clear and reliable way to:
- Understand which marketing channels perform best
- See how advertising spend translates into measurable outcomes
- Monitor performance trends over time

This project consolidates key performance metrics into a **single analytics dashboard** to support data-driven evaluation and reporting.

---

## Analytics Workflow Overview
The project follows a simple, realistic analytics workflow commonly used in business environments:

- Synthetic marketing datasets are prepared and structured
- Key performance indicators (ROAS, CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate, revenue) are calculated
- KPI tables are summarized and validated in Excel
- Final insights are visualized using a Power BI dashboard
- Outputs are shared as PDF, Excel, and web-based previews

This workflow reflects a practical analytics reporting system rather than an experimental pipeline.

## Dashboard Features
- Multi-channel performance overview  
- ROAS, CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate, and revenue metrics
