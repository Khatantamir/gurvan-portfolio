# Marketing Performance Analytics Dashboard (Portfolio)

## Overview
This repository presents a **marketing performance analytics dashboard** built as a **portfolio project**.  
The dashboard focuses on tracking key marketing KPIs such as **ROAS, CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate, and revenue trends**.

## Project Goal
Marketing teams often need a clear and reliable way to:

- Monitor performance trends over time

This project consolidates key performance metrics into a **single analytics dashboard** to support data-driven evaluation and reporting.

- Key KPIs (ROAS, CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate) are calculated
- KPI summaries are validated in Excel
- Insights are visualized using a dashboard
- Outputs are shared as PDF, Excel, and web-based previews

This reflects a **practical analytics reporting workflow**, not a research or experimental setup.
